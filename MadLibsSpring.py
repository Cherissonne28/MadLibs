#A programme to facilitate a shared game of MadLibs, in a group of 7. 
#The general theme is Spring. 
#It makes use of user input and string manipulation. 

#User inputs for Paragraph 1: 
Adjective = input("Please enter an adjective. ")
Noun_1 = input("Please enter a generic noun. ")
Exclamation = input("Please enter an exclamation, such as 'At last!'. ")

print(f"The soil combination was just {Adjective}. The {Noun_1} was balmy, without being too dry. {Exclamation}! Spring had {Past_participle_have1}. ")


print(f"{Proper_noun1} the {Capitalized_Noun} gathered {Pronoun_poss} resources, and {verb_1} a {noun_4} above the surface. All at once {Proper_noun1} was aware of many other {plural_noun1} also {present_participle} through the surfaces. ")


print(f"Over the next few days {Proper_noun1} became {Past_participle_be1} with many other {plural_noun2}: insects, birds, animals, lichens and fungi in the nearby area. The sun shone and everything rejoiced. ")
